# Table Football Client

## Description

This project is a web application built using React and Vite that allows users to start new games or log finished matches. View dashboards for team and player insights. Add players and teams and explore their profiles.

## Features

-  **Architecture**: FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) approach for clean, maintainable, and scalable project architecture. For more information, visit [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/).

-  **Styling**: The app uses `sass` and the `scss modules` approach to ensure style encapsulation and avoid global CSS conflicts.

-  **UI Components**: All user interface elements are built using MUI (Material-UI) for a polished and responsive design. Learn more about MUI at [MUI Official Website](https://mui.com/).
